Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.

                <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
                Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.
                Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.

                Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

                <h1>What is Information System?</h1>
                An information system is a combination of software, hardware, and telecommunication networks to collect useful data, especially in an organisation. Many businesses use information technology to complete and manage their operations, interact with their consumers, and stay ahead of their competition. Some companies today are completely built on information technology, like eBay, Amazon, Alibaba, and Google.

                <h1>Examples of information systems</h1>

Information systems have gained immense popularity in business operations over the years. The future of information systems and their importance depends on automation and the implementation of AI technology.

Information technology can be used for specialised and generalised purposes. A generalised information system provides a general service like a database management system where software helps organise the general form of data. For example, various data sets are obtained using a formula, providing insights into the buying trends in a certain time frame.

On the contrary, a specialised information system is built to perform a specific function for a business. For example, an expert system that solves complex problems. These problems are focused on a specific area of study like the medical system. The main aim is to offer faster and more accurate service than an individual might be able to do on his own.

Types of information systems

There are various information systems, and the type of information system a business uses depends on its goal and objective. Here are the four main types of information systems:

<ol>    
   <li> Operations support systems – The first type of information system is the operation support system. Such type of information system mainly supports a specific type of operation in a business. An example is the transaction processing system used in all banks worldwide. This type of information system enables the service provider to assess a specific process of business.</li>
   <li> Management information systems – This is the second category of information systems, consisting of hardware and software integration allowing the organisation to perform its core functions. They help in obtaining data from various online systems. The data thus obtained is not stored by the system; rather, it is analysed in a productive manner to help in the management of an organisation.</li>
   <li> Decision support systems – An organisation can make an informed decision about its operations using decision support systems. It analyses the rapidly changing information that cannot be determined in advance. It can be used in completely automated systems and human-operated systems. However, for maximum efficiency combination of human and computer-operated systems is recommended.</li>
    <li>Executive information systems – EIS or executive support system is the last category that serves as management support systems. They help in making senior-level decisions for an organisation.</li>

                Information science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. It is concerned with the body of knowledge relating to the origination, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, interpretation, transmission, and utilization of information

                Information science is the science and practice dealing with the effective collection, storage, retrieval, and use of information. It is concerned with recordable information and knowledge, and the technologies and related services that facilitate their management and use. More specifically, information science is a field of professional practice and scientific inquiry addressing the effective communication of information and information objects, particularly knowledge records, among humans in the context of social, organizational, and individual need for and use of information. The domain of information science is the transmission of the universe of human knowledge in recorded form, centering on manipulation (representation, organization, and retrieval) of information, rather than knowing information
